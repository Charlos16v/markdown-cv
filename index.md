During the last 2 years, I have been working in a software development environment where the quality of the final product was the most important thing. I have always tried to make the best decisions, the most optimal ones, and always trying to follow good practices.

My work has focused on the development of APIs based on microservices, with a clean architecture that mixes the best of all available options, which has allowed us to achieve a fairly robust and clear architecture, efficient and easy to scale. Depending on the type of project, different decisions were made, always thinking about the aim of the project.

I have occasionally worked in front-end environments, but my experience is mainly focused on the back-end.
